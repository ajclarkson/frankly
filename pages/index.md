Frankly makes publishing pages and articles on the web simple. It is a hand-coded static page and blog platform that has been built on top of the incredibly lightweight Sinatra framework, optimised to give the best performance while keeping you in control of your content.

## No Complex CMS, Just _Write_

Frankly takes websites back to basics. While powerful database run systems are fantastic, they often take the focus _away_ from content. At the end of the day, your content is your site, so there must be a better way? 

By allowing you to author your content using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/markdown), you can write in whatever environment you want. When you're done writing, you simply run a helper script and commit your changes to a git repository. That's it! Your site is updated and your content remains in markdown format, so you can jump in and make changes whenever you like. No more wrestling with a web based Rich Text Editor to try and get what you want, you can also input inline HTML directly into your markdown files if you want that extra level of customisation.

## Powerful Templating

The look and feel of your site is controlled using the powerful [HAML](http://haml.info) language. If you've never used it before, it's very straightforward, and also allows for inline HTML. Backed by your CSS and Javascript files you can customise your site to your hearts desire, then simply add in a couple of helpful placeholder tags to show where you want your page titles, content, and metadata to appear. It even generates previous/next navigation for your blog posts for you.
