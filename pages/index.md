Frankly runs on the incredibly lightweight Sinatra framework for Ruby. As everything has been handcoded from the ground up, there is absolutely no uneccessary functionality or bloat to the app. It simply takes <em>your</em> files, applies <em>your</em> templates, generates a few helpful things for you along the way and thats it. It's your content and you're in control.


## No Complex CMS, Just <em>Write</em>

With Frankly, the focus is where it should be, on the <em>content</em>. All of your content is simply written in <a href="#">Markdown</a>. No more jumping through hoops with rich text editing plugins and CMS backends, you can use whatever text editor you like, and enjoy the writing experience again. When you're done, you're nothing more than a git commit away from having your latest posts online.


## Git Deployed &amp; Secure

Chances are if you do any coding, you've come across Git. It's an excellent version control system, and it's at the heart of Frankly. Whenever you write a new article, you commit your changes in git, and it's live on your site. No FTP, no nonsense.

Because everything is done via Git, there's also no web accessible admin panel to your site. These are often targets of hacking attempts, so why bother with one?
