Frankly lives! This is being posted from the very early, bleeding edge v0.1 of the Frankly CMS. Frankly is a lightweight site platform built on the Sinatra framework. The aim is to put you back in control of your content, rather than it being tied up and spread across a series of database tables. With Frankly, you write the content in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/markdown) and Frankly creates your site navigation and links the files together into a site.

With support for both static pages and blogs even despite it being early days the CMS can provide a fast, stable, platform for your site. If you want to see more, checkout the [download](/get-frankly) page and get started with Frankly.
