I'm very pleased to announce that I've made the first public beta version of Frankly available. Version 0.9 has all of the basic functionality you'd expect from a publishing platform, here's a quick run down of the main features:

- Static Page Creation (_with automated navigation generation_)
- Blog Post Publishing
- Metadata and Blog Post Navigation Generation
- Custom Templating
- RSS Feed of Blog Posts

At the moment there's no provision for commenting, but it is possible to implement [Disqus](http://disqus.com) into your post.haml layout file. 

As for what's coming next?

- A more robust means of integrating third party comments
- (optional) Social Media buttons
- Sub-pages
- More advanced blog metadata, including author profiles
- and much, much more over future releases

Thanks for taking a look at Frankly, remember you can [subscribe](/rss.xml) for future blog updates about the future of the project, or follow the repository over on [GitHub](http://github.com/ajclarkson/frankly)
